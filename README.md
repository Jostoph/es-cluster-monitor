# Elastic Search cluster monitor

Creation of a **Go microservice** that monitors the health of an **Elastic Search cluster**.

## Goal

- Use this microservice as a monitoring tool.
- Due date: 08.01.2021

## Specifications

- The microservice should provide gRPC endpoints giving enough information to determine the health and the state of the cluster and its indices.
- The code should rely as much as possible on the standard Go library (avoid fancy libraries).
- *Bonus: packaging of the full solution using a single helm chart*
